TI  - Vericiguat Global Study in Participants with Chronic Heart Failure: Design of the 
      VICTOR trial.

AB  - AIMS: In the VICTORIA (Vericiguat Global Study in Subjects with Heart Failure 
      with Reduced Ejection Fraction) trial, the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator 
      vericiguat reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or 
      cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection 
      fraction (HFrEF) with recent worsening HF. The effect of vericiguat in patients 
      with HFrEF without recent worsening HF remains unknown. The VICTOR (Vericiguat 
      Global Study in Participants with Chronic Heart Failure) trial was designed to 
      assess the efficacy and safety of vericiguat in patients with ejection fraction 
      ≤40% without recent worsening HF on a background of current foundational HFrEF 
      therapy. METHODS: The primary endpoint for VICTOR is time to first event for the 
      composite of HHF or cardiovascular death. The trial will also assess the effect 
      of vericiguat on time to cardiovascular death, time to HHF, total HHF, and 
      all-cause death. As an event-driven trial, at least 1080 primary events are 
      expected, but follow-up will continue until the targeted number of at least 590 
      cardiovascular deaths has been reached. Approximately 6000 participants will be 
      randomized to vericiguat or placebo. CONCLUSION: VICTOR is the first large 
      event-driven HFrEF trial performed in the contemporary era of quadruple 
      foundational guideline-directed medical therapy, in a compensated ambulatory HF 
      population. VICTOR will add important information to the evidence of the effects 
      of vericiguat across the spectrum of patients with HFrEF.

TI  - Effectiveness of a nurse practitioner-led collaborative health care model on 
      self-care, functional status, rehospitalization and medical costs in heart 
      failure patients: A randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a serious and common condition that has garnered 
      significant attention in the global public health domain. It often results in 
      impaired function and reduced cardiac function status, leading to difficulties in 
      self-care and diminished quality of life. To effectively address these complex 
      challenges, the collaborative health care model has been proposed. This approach 
      has proven effective in reducing rehospitalization and lowering medical costs. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a nurse practitioner-led collaborative 
      health care model on the self-care, functional status, rehospitalization and 
      medical costs of patients with heart failure. DESIGN: A randomized controlled 
      trial design. SETTING: Cardiology department of a regional teaching hospital in 
      Southern Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: 100 patients diagnosed with heart failure. 
      METHODS: Patients diagnosed with heart failure were recruited through random 
      allocation and. randomly assigned to two groups. The control group included 50 
      patients who received routine nursing guidance; the experimental group also 
      included 50 patients who participated in a 12-week collaborative health care 
      program. Key outcomes, including self-care, functional status, rehospitalization, 
      and medical costs, which were evaluated at 12, 16, and 20 weeks post-discharge. 
      RESULTS: The intervention of the collaborative healthcare program significantly 
      impacted self-care, functional status, rehospitalization, and medical costs. 
      Significant improvements in self-care and functional status were observed at 
      20 weeks (Self-Care: β = 31.52, 95 % CI: 25.96 to 37.07, p < 0.001; Functional 
      Status: χ(2) = 22.42, p < 0.001). Regarding rehospitalization, the average 
      rehospitalization duration for the experimental group significantly increased 
      compared to 1.45 months for the control group, with the experimental group 
      averaging 3.00 months at the 20-week follow-up. Moreover, the experimental group 
      also demonstrated a reduction in rehospitalization medical costs, particularly 
      with significant effects observed in the early stages of intervention 
      (β = -6147.94, 95 % CI: -10,763.99 to -1531.88, p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: The use 
      of a nurse practitioner-led collaborative health care model significantly 
      improved self-care, function status and reduced rehospitalization while 
      effectively lowering medical costs for patients with heart failure. Through 
      professional team communication and collaboration, this approach provides more 
      effective and comprehensive care, enhances patient self-management capabilities, 
      and improves overall treatment outcomes. These results hold significant 
      implications for clinical practice and provide empirical support for future heart 
      failure care programs, warranting their widespread implementation in clinical 
      settings. REGISTRATION: This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the 
      identifier NCT04860596 on April 22, 2021, and participant recruitment was 
      initiated in April 2023. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Effectiveness of a Nurse 
      Practitioner-Led Collaborative Care Model: Reduces rehospitalization and medical 
      costs, while improving self-care and functional status in heart failure patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that haemodynamic-guided management 
      using an implantable pulmonary artery pressure monitor reduces heart failure 
      hospitalisations in patients with moderately symptomatic (New York Heart 
      Association [NYHA] functional class III) chronic heart failure and a 
      hospitalisation in the past year, irrespective of ejection fraction. It is 
      unclear if these benefits extend to patients with mild (NYHA functional class II) 
      or severe (NYHA functional class IV) symptoms of heart failure or to patients 
      with elevated natriuretic peptides without a recent heart failure 
      hospitalisation. This trial was designed to evaluate whether haemodynamic-guided 
      management using remote pulmonary artery pressure monitoring could reduce heart 
      failure events and mortality in patients with heart failure across the spectrum 
      of symptom severity (NYHA funational class II-IV), including those with elevated 
      natriuretic peptides but without a recent heart failure hospitalisation. METHODS: 
      The randomised arm of the haemodynamic-GUIDEed management of Heart Failure 
      (GUIDE-HF) trial was a multicentre, single-blind study at 118 centres in the USA 
      and Canada. Following successful implantation of a pulmonary artery pressure 
      monitor, patients with all ejection fractions, NYHA functional class II-IV 
      chronic heart failure, and either a recent heart failure hospitalisation or 
      elevated natriuretic peptides (based on a-priori thresholds) were randomly 
      assigned (1:1) to either haemodynamic-guided heart failure management based on 
      pulmonary artery pressure or a usual care control group. Patients were masked to 
      their study group assignment. Investigators were aware of treatment assignment 
      but did not have access to pulmonary artery pressure data for control patients. 
      The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and total heart 
      failure events (heart failure hospitalisations and urgent heart failure hospital 
      visits) at 12 months assessed in all randomly assigned patients. Safety was 
      assessed in all patients. A pre-COVID-19 impact analysis for the primary and 
      secondary outcomes was prespecified. This study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03387813. FINDINGS: Between March 15, 2018, and Dec 20, 
      2019, 1022 patients were enrolled, with 1000 patients implanted successfully, and 
      follow-up was completed on Jan 8, 2021. There were 253 primary endpoint events 
      (0·563 per patient-year) among 497 patients in the haemodynamic-guided management 
      group (treatment group) and 289 (0·640 per patient-year) in 503 patients in the 
      control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·88, 95% CI 0·74-1·05; p=0·16). A prespecified 
      COVID-19 sensitivity analysis using a time-dependent variable to compare events 
      before COVID-19 and during the pandemic suggested a treatment interaction 
      (p(interaction)=0·11) due to a change in the primary endpoint event rate during 
      the pandemic phase of the trial, warranting a pre-COVID-19 impact analysis. In 
      the pre-COVID-19 impact analysis, there were 177 primary events (0·553 per 
      patient-year) in the intervention group and 224 events (0·682 per patient-year) 
      in the control group (HR 0·81, 95% CI 0·66-1·00; p=0·049). This difference in 
      primary events almost disappeared during COVID-19, with a 21% decrease in the 
      control group (0·536 per patient-year) relative to pre-COVID-19, virtually no 
      change in the treatment group (0·597 per patient-year), and no difference between 
      groups (HR 1·11, 95% CI 0·80-1·55; p=0·53). The cumulative incidence of heart 
      failure events was not reduced by haemodynamic-guided management (0·85, 
      0·70-1·03; p=0·096) in the overall study analysis but was significantly decreased 
      in the pre-COVID-19 impact analysis (0·76, 0·61-0·95; p=0·014). 1014 (99%) of 
      1022 patients had freedom from device or system-related complications. 
      INTERPRETATION: Haemodynamic-guided management of heart failure did not result in 
      a lower composite endpoint rate of mortality and total heart failure events 
      compared with the control group in the overall study analysis. However, a 
      pre-COVID-19 impact analysis indicated a possible benefit of haemodynamic-guided 
      management on the primary outcome in the pre-COVID-19 period, primarily driven by 
      a lower heart failure hospitalisation rate compared with the control group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness and adverse effects of coenzyme Q10 for heart 
      failure remain unclear owing to small sample sizes and variations in the quality 
      of existing studies in literature. METHODS: The databases of EMBASE, PubMed, Web 
      of Science, CINAHL databases, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials, VIP, Wanfang, and CNKI were searched for randomized controlled trials on 
      the coenzyme Q10-assisted treatment of heart failure. Relevant literature was 
      retrieved, data were extracted, and the risk of bias of the included studies was 
      evaluated by two investigators independently using the Review Manager 5.4 
      software and the STATA 15 software. RESULTS: In total, 33 studies were included 
      in this meta-analysis, which showed that all-cause mortality [RR = 0.64, 95% CI 
      (0.48, 0.85), P = 0.002; GRADE: moderate quality], hospitalization for heart 
      failure [RR = 0.50, 95% CI (0.37, 0.67), P < 0.00001; GRADE: moderate quality], 
      New York Heart Association classification [MD = - 0.29, 95% CI (- 0.39, - 0.19), 
      P < 0.00001; GRADE: low quality], and brain natriuretic peptide level 
      [MD = - 91.97, 95% CI (- 103.11, - 80.83), P < 0.00001; GRADE: low quality] were 
      lower in the coenzyme Q10 group than in the control group. Meanwhile, left 
      ventricular ejection fraction [MD = 0.51, 95% CI (0.31, 0.71), P < 0.00001; 
      GRADE: low quality] and 6-min walk test result [MD = 31.70, 95% CI (19.96, 
      43.43), P < 0.00001; GRADE: moderate quality] were better than those in the 
      control group. CONCLUSIONS: According to the existing evidence, coenzyme Q10 
      reduces all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, New York Heart 
      Association classification, and brain natriuretic peptide level and improves left 
      ventricular ejection fraction and 6-min walk test result in those with heart 
      failure without major adverse effects. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study protocol 
      was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews 
      (PROSPERO, http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero ), with the registration number 
      CRD42023493184.

AB  - Conduction system pacing (CSP) has emerged as a promising alternative to 
      biventricular pacing (BVP) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection 
      fraction (HFrEF) and ventricular dyssynchrony, but its benefits are uncertain. In 
      this study, we aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes of CSP vs BVP for cardiac 
      resynchronization in patients with HFrEF. PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases 
      were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing CSP to BVP for 
      resynchronization therapy in patients with HFrEF. Heterogeneity was examined with 
      I(2) statistics. A random-effects model was used for all outcomes. We included 7 
      randomized controlled trials with 408 patients, of whom 200 (49%) underwent CSP. 
      Compared to BVP, CSP resulted in a significantly greater reduction in QRS 
      duration (MD -13.34 ms; 95% confidence interval [CI] -24.32 to -2.36, P = .02; 
      I(2) = 91%) and New York Heart Association functional class (standardized mean 
      difference [SMD] -0.37; 95% CI -0.69 to -0.05; P = .02; I(2) = 41%), and a 
      significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (mean difference [MD] 
      2.06%; 95% CI 0.16 to 3.97; P = .03; I(2) = 0%). No statistical difference was 
      noted for left ventricular end-systolic volume (SMD -0.51 mL; 95% CI -1.26 to 
      0.24; P = .18; I(2) = 83%), lead capture threshold (MD -0.08 V; 95% CI -0.42 to 
      0.27; P = .66; I(2) = 66%), and procedure time (MD 5.99 minutes; 95% CI -15.91 to 
      27.89; P = .59; I(2) = 79%). These findings suggest that CSP may have 
      electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and symptomatic benefits over BVP for 
      patients with HFrEF requiring cardiac resynchronization.

PG  - 100-116

AB  - Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) remains the major parameter for 
      diagnosis, phenotyping, prognosis and treatment decisions in heart failure. The 
      2016 ESC heart failure guidelines introduced a third EF category for an EF of 
      40-49%, defined as heart failure with mid-range EF (HFmrEF). This category has 
      been largely unexplored compared with heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF; 
      defined as EF <40% in this Review) and heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF; 
      defined as EF ≥50%). The prevalence of HFmrEF within the overall population of 
      patients with HF is 10-25%. HFmrEF seems to be an intermediate clinical entity 
      between HFrEF and HFpEF in some respects, but more similar to HFrEF in others, in 
      particular with regard to the high prevalence of ischaemic heart disease in these 
      patients. HFmrEF is milder than HFrEF, and the risk of cardiovascular events is 
      lower in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF than in those with HFrEF. By contrast, the 
      risk of non-cardiovascular adverse events is similar or greater in patients with 
      HFmrEF or HFpEF than in those with HFrEF. Evidence from post hoc and subgroup 
      analyses of randomized clinical trials and a trial of an SGLT1-SGLT2 inhibitor 
      suggests that drugs that are effective in patients with HFrEF might also be 
      effective in patients with HFmrEF. Although the EF is a continuous measure with 
      considerable variability, in this comprehensive Review we suggest that HFmrEF is 
      a useful categorization of patients with HF and shares the most important 
      clinical features with HFrEF, which supports the renaming of HFmrEF to HF with 
      mildly reduced EF.

TI  - Comparative cardiovascular benefits of individual SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 
      diabetes and heart failure: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of 
      randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 1216160

LID - 1216160
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a history of heart failure 
      (HF), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have demonstrated 
      cardiovascular (CV) benefits. However, the comparative efficacy of individual 
      SGLT2is remains uncertain. This network meta-analysis (NMA) compared the efficacy 
      and safety of five SGLT2is (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, 
      ertugliflozin, and sotagliflozin) on CV outcomes in these patients. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      were searched up to September 23, 2022, to identify all randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) comparing SGLT2is to placebo in T2D patients with HF. The main 
      outcomes included composite CV death/heart failure hospitalization (HFH), HFH, CV 
      death, all-cause mortality, and adverse events. Pairwise and NMA approaches were 
      applied. RESULTS: Our analysis included 11 RCTs with a total of 20,438 patients 
      with T2D and HF. All SGLT2is significantly reduced HFH compared to standard of 
      care (SoC) alone. "Add-on" SGLT2is, except ertugliflozin, significantly reduced 
      composite CV death/HFH relative to SoC alone. Moreover, canagliflozin had lower 
      composite CV death/HFH compared to dapagliflozin. Based on the surface under the 
      cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), the top-ranked SGLT2is for reducing HFH were 
      canagliflozin (95.5%), sotagliflozin (66.0%), and empagliflozin (57.2%). 
      Head-to-head comparisons found no significant differences between individual 
      SGLT2is in reducing CV death. "Add-on" SGLT2is reduced all-cause mortality 
      compared with SoC alone, although only dapagliflozin was statistically 
      significant. No SGLT2is were significantly associated with serious adverse 
      events. A sensitivity analysis focusing on HF-specific trials found that 
      dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin significantly reduced composite 
      CV death/HFH, consistent with the main analysis. However, no significant 
      differences were identified from their head-to-head comparisons in the NMA. The 
      SUCRA indicated that sotagliflozin had the highest probability of reducing 
      composite CV death/HFH (97.6%), followed by empagliflozin (58.4%) and 
      dapagliflozin (44.0%). CONCLUSION: SGLT2is significantly reduce the composite CV 
      death/HFH outcome. Among them, canagliflozin may be considered the preferred 
      treatment for patients with diabetes and a history of heart failure, but it may 
      also be associated with an increased risk of any adverse events compared to other 
      SGLT2is. However, a sensitivity analysis focusing on HF-specific trials 
      identified sotagliflozin as the most likely agent to reduce CV death/HFH, 
      followed by empagliflozin and dapagliflozin. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:

TI  - The Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart 
      Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): Rationale and design.
PG  - 2453-2463
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.3453 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in heart failure 
      with preserved and mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF/HFmrEF) have not been 
      established. Conventional randomized controlled trials are complex and expensive. 
      The Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart 
      Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF) is a unique pragmatic 
      registry-based randomized controlled trial. METHODS: SPIRRIT-HFpEF is a 
      multicentre, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint trial 
      conducted on platforms in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF) and the 
      United States (US) Trial Innovation Network. Patients with HFpEF/HFmrEF are 
      randomized 1:1 to spironolactone (or eplerenone) in addition to usual care, 
      versus usual care alone. The primary outcome is total number of cardiovascular 
      deaths and hospitalizations for heart failure. Outcomes are collected from 
      Swedish administrative complete coverage registries and a US call centre and 
      subsequently adjudicated. Simple eligibility criteria were based on data 
      available in SwedeHF: heart failure as outpatient or at discharge from hospital, 
      left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40%, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic 
      peptide >300 ng/L (in sinus rhythm) or >750 ng/L (in atrial fibrillation), with 
      pre-specified adjustment for elevated body mass index, and chronic loop diuretic 
      use. Power and sample size assessments were based on an event-driven design 
      allowing enrolment over approximately 6 years, and application of hazard ratios 
      from the TOPCAT trial, Americas subset. The final sample size is expected to be 
      approximately 2400 patients. CONCLUSION: SPIRRIT-HFpEF will be informative on the 
      effectiveness of generic MRAs in HFpEF and HFmrEF, and on the feasibility of 
      conducting pragmatic and registry-based trials in heart failure and other chronic 
      conditions.

TI  - Comparative effects of furosemide and other diuretics in the treatment of heart 
      failure: a systematic review and combined meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials.
PG  - 127-136
LID - 10.1007/s10741-020-10003-7 [doi]
AB  - Diuretics have an essential role in the management of heart failure (HF). 
      However, each drug has its own benefit and side effect. Side effects include 
      fluid, electrolyte abnormalities, and acid-base disturbance. These adverse 
      effects of diuretics predispose patients to serious cardiac arrhythmias and may 
      increase the risk of arrhythmic mortality. Herein, we aim to summarize the 
      relative efficacy and safety of all available diuretics used in the treatment of 
      patients with HF. In June 2017, a systematic electronic database search was 
      conducted in nine databases. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 
      the different diuretics used in HF were included for meta-analysis. The protocol 
      was registered in Prospero with CRD42018084819. Among the included 54 studies 
      (10,740 patients), 34 RCTs were eligible for quantitative network meta-analysis 
      (NMA) and traditional meta-analysis while the other 20 studies were qualitatively 
      analyzed. Our results showed that azosemide and torasemide caused a significant 
      reduction in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level. Torasemide also caused a 
      significant decrease in collagen volume fraction (CVF) and edema. No significant 
      difference between the agents concerning glomerular filtration rate (GFR), water 
      extraction, and sodium excretion was demonstrated. Regarding side effects, no 
      significant difference among diuretics was observed in terms of hospital 
      readmission and mortality rates. Diuretics are the main treatment of hypervolemia 
      in HF patients. The choice of appropriate diuretic is essential for successful 
      management and is mainly guided by patient clinical situations and the presence 
      of other co-morbidities.

      DM randomised trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the STEP-HFpEF (NCT04788511) and STEP-HFpEF DM (NCT04916470) 
      trials, the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide improved symptoms, physical 
      limitations, bodyweight, and exercise function in people with obesity-related 
      heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. In this prespecified pooled 
      analysis of the STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM trials, we aimed to provide a more 
      definitive assessment of the effects of semaglutide across a range of outcomes 
      and to test whether these effects were consistent across key patient subgroups. 
      METHODS: We conducted a prespecified pooled analysis of individual patient data 
      from STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
      trials at 129 clinical research sites in 18 countries. In both trials, eligible 
      participants were aged 18 years or older, had heart failure with a left 
      ventricular ejection fraction of at least 45%, a BMI of at least 30 kg/m(2), New 
      York Heart Association class II-IV symptoms, and a Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
      Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS; a measure of heart 
      failure-related symptoms and physical limitations) of less than 90 points. In 
      STEP-HFpEF, people with diabetes or glycated haemoglobin A(1c) concentrations of 
      at least 6·5% were excluded, whereas for inclusion in STEP-HFpEF DM participants 
      had to have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at least 90 days before screening 
      and to have an HbA(1c) of 10% or lower. In both trials, participants were 
      randomly assigned to either 2·4 mg semaglutide once weekly or matched placebo for 
      52 weeks. The dual primary endpoints were change from baseline to week 52 in 
      KCCQ-CSS and bodyweight in all randomly assigned participants. Confirmatory 
      secondary endpoints included change from baseline to week 52 in 6-min walk 
      distance, a hierarchical composite endpoint (all-cause death, heart failure 
      events, and differences in changes in KCCQ-CSS and 6-min walk distance); and 
      C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Heterogeneity in treatment effects was 
      assessed across subgroups of interest. We assessed safety in all participants who 
      received at least one dose of study drug. FINDINGS: Between March 19, 2021 and 
      March 9, 2022, 529 people were randomly assigned in STEP-HFpEF, and between June 
      27, 2021 and Sept 2, 2022, 616 were randomly assigned in STEP-HFpEF DM. Overall, 
      1145 were included in our pooled analysis, 573 in the semaglutide group and 572 
      in the placebo group. Improvements in KCCQ-CSS and reductions in bodyweight 
      between baseline and week 52 were significantly greater in the semaglutide group 
      than in the placebo group (mean between-group difference for the change from 
      baseline to week 52 in KCCQ-CSS 7·5 points [95% CI 5·3 to 9·8]; p<0·0001; mean 
      between-group difference in bodyweight at week 52 -8·4% [-9·2 to -7·5]; 
      p<0·0001). For the confirmatory secondary endpoints, 6-min walk distance (mean 
      between-group difference at week 52 17·1 metres [9·2 to 25·0]) and the 
      hierarchical composite endpoint (win ratio 1·65 [1·42 to 1·91]) were 
      significantly improved, and CRP concentrations (treatment ratio 0·64 [0·56 to 
      0·72]) were significantly reduced, in the semaglutide group compared with the 
      placebo group (p<0·0001 for all comparisons). For the dual primary endpoints, the 
      efficacy of semaglutide was largely consistent across multiple subgroups, 
      including those defined by age, race, sex, BMI, systolic blood pressure, baseline 
      CRP, and left ventricular ejection fraction. 161 serious adverse events were 
      reported in the semaglutide group compared with 301 in the placebo group. 
      INTERPRETATION: In this prespecified pooled analysis of the STEP-HFpEF and 
      STEP-HFpEF DM trials, semaglutide was superior to placebo in improving heart 
      failure-related symptoms and physical limitations, and reducing bodyweight in 
      participants with obesity-related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. 
      These effects were largely consistent across patient demographic and clinical 
      characteristics. Semaglutide was well tolerated. FUNDING: Novo Nordisk.
